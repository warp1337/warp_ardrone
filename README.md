# falkor_ardrone: A ROS package to control an AR.Drone autonomously

## Introduction

"warp_ardrone" is a [ROS](http://ros.org/ "Robot Operating System") package which uses the "ardrone_autonomy" package
(originally from Brown, now from AutonomyLab) to implement autonomous control functionality on an AR.Drone. "warp_ardrone"
package is  additionally based on the great "falkor_ardrone package" [Falkor Systems] (https://github.com/FalkorSystems),
therefore I left their BSD and Copyright statements intact!

More detail on this particular package follow...

### Updates

- *August 10th, 2013*: Initial Release

## Usage

Once the AR.Drone is connected to your computer via WiFi, run

     ```bash
     $ roslaunch warp_ardrone warp-init.launch
     ```
